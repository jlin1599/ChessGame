Chess Game Implementation Link : https://jlin159chess.netlify.app/

This project implements a basic chess game board with drag-and-drop functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create an interactive chess experience that allows players to move pieces, alternate turns, and determine the winner when a king is captured.

Features:
Interactive Drag-and-Drop: Players can drag and drop pieces to valid squares on the board.
Player Turn Tracking: Automatically alternates turns between "white" and "black" players.
Win Condition: The game detects when a king is captured and announces the winner.
Board Setup: Initial chess piece positions are dynamically generated.
Responsive Design: The gameboard adapts to different screen sizes.

Technologies Used:
HTML: To structure the game board and pieces.
CSS: For styling the board and pieces.
JavaScript: For game logic, drag-and-drop functionality, and win condition checks.

How to Play:
The game starts with the "white" player.
Drag a piece to a valid square:
You cannot move onto a square occupied by your own pieces.
You can capture an opponent's piece by dragging your piece onto their square.
Turns alternate between "white" and "black" players.
The game ends when a king is captured, and the winner is displayed.
